			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<h2> EPILEPSY WARNING! FLASHING LIGHTS!</h2>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I started with a program that generates a bunch of tiny circles all the color gray and all connected to each other. </p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>First I wanted to make sure that the number of circles was less, and that they were not connected. I wanted to create a sort of “dipping dots” generative feel while also making sure that the majority of the dots were one unifying color to make it look more aesthetic.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>I was much closer to my main goal after this, last step, but the dots were still too small and too many, and they were a boring gray color, I solved this problem by simply changing a few variables in the original code, but to get the rainbow assortment of colors that I wanted, I stored random color values and gave each new dot a different color, however, I still wanted to make my project unique so I colored the circles in one of the for loops so that I could create a cool, glowing strobe effect. Below is the final result.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>I did the entire thing</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>I put in a lot of work trying to create the strobe effect.</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<li>It was hard to get things colored and sized properly but the final result made it worth it</li>
				</ul>
