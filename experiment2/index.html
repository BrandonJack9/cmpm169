			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation and Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I started with the example code for Orbit Control, it had a bunch of cones and boxes aligned in 3D space in an interesting spherical shape.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>First I decided to get rid of the display of the sphereical assortment of 3D objects in order to make something of my own design. I integrated spheres into the design as well as 2D vector art and aligned them in a way that created something which resembled a silly character floating in 3D space</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>I combined the shapes and had them overlapping with custom colors to make it look like a silly character. I also had the character rotating to show of its entirety in 3D space while also allowing the observer to move around the world and percieve the character from different angles</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					I did the entire thing
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					I put in a lot of work aligning everything just right to make it look silly and funny and cool 
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					It was hard to get things aligned properly and thats probably what I spent most of my time doing 
				</ul>
